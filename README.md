# Social-Network-API
This project is a backend API for a social network application built with Express.js and MongoDB. It allows users to share thoughts, react to friends' posts, and manage a friend list. The API uses Mongoose ODM for database modeling and supports timestamp formatting with a JavaScript date library or the native Date object.
